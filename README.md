## Business Requirements

In the following sections the business requirements will be explained, firstly a section describing the background followed by a problem statement, finally a description of the business case.

### Background

Our client, going by the alias 'Lydia Doe', has received an inheritance from a deceased great-grandfather. Included in the inheritance are four houses located in Ames, Iowa, USA. Lydia seeks assistance in maximizing the sales price for these inherited properties. To achieve this goal, she has chosen to enlist the help of a Data Practitioner. Her reasons for doing so include:

- Lydia lacks knowledge about the value of the properties and wishes to avoid the risk of inaccurate pricing estimation. Given the potential for significant financial gains or losses when selling the four properties, she seeks assistance to ensure optimal pricing strategies.
- Additionally, Lydia is keen on predicting the sale price of any house in Ames, Iowa, for potential future property ownership in the area 

From searching the Internet, Lydia found a public dataset with house prices for Ames, Iowa, and will provide us with that. We will build a Data Web App to predict the sales price from the four houses based on the house attributes. 

### Work methodology

To achieve our goal, we will use the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) workflow. This workflow is documented and reflected in the logical order in which the files were created, aligning with the stages of the CRISP-DM process. While the framework guides us to create files and work in a specific sequence, we also incorporate agile principles. This allows us to iterate and refine our solution, ensuring we deliver an optimal final product that meets the client's requirements.

The following steps defines the CRISP-DM workflow, after each a point, a corresponding file or readme section is defined to explain the overall connection (best fit) between the stages and files and methods described in this project.

### Problem definition

While the client is well-versed in the determinants of property worth in her own area, it's crucial to understand the unique drivers of value in Ames, Iowa. The client worries that her personal expertise may not be adequate to accurately assess the value, potentially resulting in erroneous appraisals and financial losses.


### Requirements

* 1. - The client is interested in identifying which house attributes have the strongest correlation with the sale price. 

* 2. - The client expects data visualisations of the correlated variables against the sale price to show that.

* 3. - The client is interested in predicting the house sale price from her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.


### User stories

- User Story 1: As a user, I want to view the attributes correlated to the sale price, so that I can identify the key features for upcoming sales.
- User Story 2: As a user, I want to be able to determine the likely sale price of a home based on certain features, so that I can gain insight into the likely values of a given home in the area.
- User Story 3: As a user, I want to be able to view the four main key features with a threshold score of 0.8, so that I can easily see the features that are most relevant from a predictive power score perspective.

## Hypothesis, validation and result

1. Hypothesis: Sales price house attribute correlation:
   We assume that associoated variables for the following four features has the strongest correlation: lot area, property size, condition and age of the property:
    - Validation: Evaluate the available house attributes in a correlation study, mention the the values above 0,6 for either Spearman or Pearson correlation.
    - Result: From the calculations we can see that some of our assesement of features were correct, below is the details explained:     
    * OverallQual - Correct, associated to condition.
    * GrLivArea - Correct, associated to size.
    * GarageArea - Correct, associated to size.   
    * TotalBsmtSF - Correct, associated to size.  
    * YearBuilt -  Correct, associated to age.
    * 1stFlrSF - Correct, associated to size.

    * Note: **lot area** is not part of property size so in this case the assumption was incorrect.  

2. Hypothesis: Determine sales price:
   We assume that the following variables will be sufficient to confidently predict the price: lot area, house size (1stFlrSF ), overall quality and the build year.
   - Validation: Use a machine learning model and optimization procedures to ensure the application of appropriate methods.
   - Result: We noticed also in this case a partial match to the assumption.
    * OverallQual - Correct
    * TotalBsmtSF - Incorrect, this area variable were not part of the assumption.
    * 2ndFlrSF - Incorrect, this area variable were not part of the assumption.
    * GarageArea - Correct

3.  Hypothesis: Sales price evolution:
   We assume that the four features found in Hypothesis 2 is sufficient to reach a 0.8 could be used as predictive power indicator:
   - Validation: Review the result from the trained models in Hypothesis 2 and display it in the streamlit app.
   - Result: Correct, the four features were able to use as confidently predict house sale prices, the RÂ² score of 0.886 on the training set and 0.84 on the test set suggests that the model explains a large portion of the variance in the sale prices, which is a good sign. It means that these four features are indeed very important and provide significant predictive power.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

 Business Requirement 1: Correlation Study
- Task 1: Inspect the data provided by the client to ensure it is clean and ready for analysis.
- Task 2: Conduct correlation studies to identify which variables have the strongest impact on house sale prices.
- Task 3: Plot significant variables against sale prices to visualize their relationships.

Business Requirement 2: Data Visualization
- Task 1: Apply data handling techniques to prepare various data types for visualization.
- Task 2: Identify and use the most suitable trendlines or plots based on the distribution and characteristics of the data.
- Task 3: Create clear and informative visualizations to highlight the correlations between house attributes and sale prices.

Business Requirement 3: Predictive Modeling
- Task 1: Implement a predictive model to estimate house sale prices.
- Task 2: Handle missing data effectively to ensure accurate predictions for all variables.
- Task 3: Provide the client with a tool or method to predict the sale prices of her four inherited houses and any other house in Ames, Iowa.

## ML Business Case

### Predict Sales price
We want an ML model to predict sale price, in dollars, for a home in Ames, Iowa. The target variable is a continuous number. We firstly consider a regression model, which is supervised and uni-dimensional.
Our ideal outcome is to provide a client with the ability to reliably predict the sale price of any home in Ames, Iowa, and more specifically the inherited properties the client is particularly concerned with.
The model success metrics are:
At least 0.8 for R2 score, on train and test set.
The model is considered a failure if: after 12 months of usage, the model predictions are 50% off more than 30% of the time, and/or the R2 score is less than 0.8.
The output is defined as a continuous value of sale price in dollars. Private parties/home owners/clients can access the app online and input data for their homes. The app can also be useful for real estate agents who want to give a quick estimate of saleprice to a prospective client, they can input the data on the fly while in live communication with a prospective client.
The training data come from a public data set, which contains approx. 1500 property sales records. It contains one target features: sale price, and all other variables (23 of them) are considered features.


#### Regression Model
   * We want an ML model to predict sales price, in months, for a prospect expected to churn. A target variable is a discrete number. We consider a regression model, which is supervised and uni-dimensional.
   * Our ideal outcome is to provide our sales team with reliable insight into onboarding customers with a higher sense of loyalty.
   * The model success metrics are
   * At least 0.8 for R2 score, on train and test set
   * The ML model is considered a failure if:
      * after 12 months of usage, the model's predictions are 50% off more than 30% of the time. Say, a prediction is >50% off if predicted 10 months and the actual value was 2 months.
   * The output is defined as a continuous value for tenure in months. It is assumed that this model will predict tenure if the Predict Churn Classifier predicts 1 (yes for churn). If the prospect is online, the prospect will have already provided the input data via a form. If the prospect talks to a salesperson, the salesperson will interview to gather the input data and feed it into the App. The prediction is made on the fly (not in batches).

The predictive model should aim to acchieve an R2 value of 0.8 or higher
