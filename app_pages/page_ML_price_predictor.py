    " We started by checking for missing values and validating analysis types."
    " Next, we performed normality tests using the Shapiro-Wilk method to identify"

    " We then applied various transformations, such as logarithmic, power"
    " Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson, ordinal encoding, and Winsorization,to address"
    " data skewness and normalize distributions."
    " The effectiveness of these transformations was evaluated using the" 
    " Shapiro-Wilk test to ensure improved normality."
    " Additionally, we implemented feature selection techniques to handle"
    " multicollinearity and select the most relevant features."
